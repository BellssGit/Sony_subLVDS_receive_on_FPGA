# Sony_subLVDS_receive_on_FPGA

A subLVDS receive implementation on Lattice ECP5 FPGA.

This is designed for a very specific sensor model (IMX178) and use Lattice Diamond IP core. But I think it might help some people so I upload it to github.

A [blog post](https://www.emoe.xyz/sony_sublvds_on_fpga/) describe more detail (Chinese Only)
